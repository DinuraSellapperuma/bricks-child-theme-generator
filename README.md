# Bricks Child Theme Generator

A **one-page** generator to quickly create a WordPress child theme for [Bricks Builder](https://bricksbuilder.io). This generator:

- Accepts user input for **Theme Name**, **Version**, **Author**, etc.
- Automatically creates the necessary **style.css**, **functions.php**, and **screenshot.png** (uploaded by the user).
- Generates a **ZIP** file ready to be installed as a child theme.

## How To Use

1. **Clone** or **download** this repo.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Fill out the form fields and upload a screenshot (PNG/JPG up to 1MB).
4. Click **"Generate Theme ðŸš€"** to download the custom child theme.

## Notes

- The generated child theme automatically references the `bricks` parent theme (`Template: bricks` in `style.css`).
- The included code in `functions.php` takes care of:
  - Enqueuing child theme CSS.
  - Registering a custom element, `title.php`, for Bricks Builder.
  - Deleting certain WordPress default files (like `license.txt` or `readme.html`) â€” remove or comment out if not desired.
