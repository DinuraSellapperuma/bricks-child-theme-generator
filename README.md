## Local Development & Contribution

1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bricks-child-theme-generator.git

## Notes

- The generated child theme automatically references the `bricks` parent theme (`Template: bricks` in `style.css`).
- The included code in `functions.php` takes care of:
  - Enqueuing child theme CSS.
  - Registering a custom element, `title.php`, for Bricks Builder.
  - Deleting certain WordPress default files (like `license.txt` or `readme.html`) â€” remove or comment out if not desired.
  - Note: I have added code to delete these unnecessary files for WordPress security purposes. Deleting certain default WordPress filesâ€”like license.txt,       
    readme.html, wp-config-sample.php, and xmlrpc.phpâ€”for security purposes. Feel free to remove or comment out this feature if you donâ€™t want to delete these 
    files.
